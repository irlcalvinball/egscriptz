sudonimo: Fade in.

me, 2: This bitch had the nerve to give me a Michael Kors bag.
me, 3: Do I look like a pleb?
Him, 4: Here we go.

me, 6: Second prize goes to Moschino.
Him, 7: What about Off-White?
me, 8: That's on my list too.

Him, 10: Glad we're on the same page.
Him, 11: I can't stand faux-couture.
me, 13: It's like they're missing something vital to the human experience. I could never live like that.
Him, 14: Like a reverse tumor.
Him, 16: Except you give the cancer to others instead of keeping it yourself.
me, 17: Yea talk about cancer-spreading.
me, 19: Now I have to get rid of this thing before I get infected.
Him, 20: You gonna sell it?
me, 22: I was thinking of burning it at the stake.
Him, 24: Ha. We should write spells to ward off any future misgivings.
me, 25: You know.
Him, 27: Maybe sprinkle some oregano for those smoking mids thinking it's gas too.
me, 29: No don't do that, the smell will just attract those suckas.
Him, 30: True.
me, 31: My witchiness tells me we should do it tonight.
me, 32: At sundown.
Him, 33: There's that barbeque place we can do it at.
me, 35: Ima burn an incense right now just to make sure I'm safe.
Him, 37: So who was the unfortunate gift-giver?
me, 39: An aspiring actor, who has the shits for me.
me, 40: The usual.
Him, 42: Sounds like you are quite admired.
Him, 43: Too admired, even.
me, 44: Hot girl shit.
me, 45: You get used to it.
Him, 47: Maybe you need some tougher spells.
me, 49: I need some spells that will ward off evil spirits and then some.
me, 50: I need your toughest spells.
Him, 52: I'll write these in a language no one can understand.
Him, 53: That should do the trick.
me, 54: Let's hope so.
Him, 56: How many of these admirers do you have?
me, 57: My instagram has 200k followers.
Him, 59: I wouldn't even know how to comprehend that.
Him, 62: Like there are thousands of people around the world looking at your story everyday?
Him, 63: How does that feel?
me, 64: Empty.
Him, 65: I see.
me, 66: Getting free shit is usually fun.
me, 67: I got this care package from Lindt chocolate once.
me, 68: That was cool.
Him, 69: Ahh, the life of a post-modern celebrity.
Him, 70: Or are we at post-post-modern now?
Him, 71: I can never keep track.
me, 72: Life of an e-girl.
Him, 74: That. Is what I wanted to say.
me, 76: Are you sure you've never had fans?
me, 78: I kind of don't believe that you never had groupies.
Him, 82: Well I did, once...
me, 84: Wait, I need to drink something. Hold that thought.
Him, 85: OK...

sudonimo, 88: Fade out like a motherfucker.
